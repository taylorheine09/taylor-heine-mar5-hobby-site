Finding new direction in Finding Nemo. This being one of Pixar’s most ambitious films yet, a lot of research went into the making of this film. Pixar hired Adam Summers, a fish biomechanics expert, to provide the team with knowledge on marine life. I’m really glad that they consulted with this guy too, because the eyebrows on the fish (presumably Dory) do not fit both aesthetically or biologically. The Renderman render engine did a fantastic job at portraying the look and feel of being underwater surrounded by flourishing marine life, all thanks to Adam Summers’ expert info. 



Finding Nemo has some of Pixar’s best concept art that is both beautiful and ground breaking for the company. The exploration of colour, along with the study of fish anatomy, has brought a sense of realism and beauty that the studio haden’t produced yet. Yes their 4 previous films all explored lighting, art work, and technological breakthroughs, they hadn’t yet pushed the boundaries of animation yet as other studios like Dreamworks have begun to do their own high budget 3d animations such as Shrek that were somewhat along the same lines. The introduction of fluid physics and light refraction have truly pushed Pixar forward.



Pixar further explored water and fluid simulations with their film, The Good Dinosaur, which has some of the most realistic water simulations out of any film I’ve seen. These simulations along with all their other groundbreaking technologies came together to produce Finding Dory which had even more convincing water than their previous films. Overall, the computer scientists and animation experts at Pixar have truly revolutionized 3D graphics and have put Pixar as the pinnacle of the animation sector.
