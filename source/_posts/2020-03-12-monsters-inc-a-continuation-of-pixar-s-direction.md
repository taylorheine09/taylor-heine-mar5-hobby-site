About 5 years after the initial success with Toy Story, the sequel, and A Bug’s Life, Pixar came out with Monsters, Inc. The film explores 2 monsters who end up discovering a small child who had followed Sulley back into the monster world, and it is their task to return her home. The initial sketches and concepts were still in fine art mediums. The company still focusing on three main principles that include their attention to detail, art direction, and tech inovation.



The attention to detail has ramped up a bit more compared to their first movie. At this point, they are hiding easter eggs, and other references to their other movies in the background. The number of polygons and objects on screen has also drastically increased. They now have hundreds of people working on the movie and have more time to devote to this sort of thing now, however, they are still in their early years with only 3 franchises under their belt.



The art direction for Monsters, Inc. still has resemblance to their other films including the environment design, lighting, and character design. The image above are a few early coloured pencil concepts of Sulley who is one of the main characters. There are many unique models and environments in this movie compared to their previous 3 that took place in limited settings. This provided the artists an opportunity to explore how they would design this new unique world. They also had the opportunity to delve into world building and creature design. 



The thing that the animators focused most on in this film was Sulley’s fur. He is one of the very first characters with a full body of a hair simulation. The fur actively interacts with his movement and environment, and has further cemented Pixar as the leading edge of animation in the world. At this point, no other studio has accomplished as much as Pixar.
