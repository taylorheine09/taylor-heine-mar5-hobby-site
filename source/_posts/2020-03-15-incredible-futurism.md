Pixar had never really been good at doing human animation in the past, so this film was a bit of a risk for the studio. Luckily for us, Pixar has always been known for taking risks in their drive to push animation beyond it’s limits. With this movie, Pixar wanted to reminisce in their childhood memories of the “Golden Age” of comic books. They married the idea with an art style similar to the Futurism era that had a lot of shapes and specific styles of shading that was familiar in the painting style. It is apparent in the characters appearances that they are stylized in a way that emphasizes geometric shapes. Similar can be said about the backgrounds and environments.



This movie was made in a time that was still before Marvel Studios was developed and acquired by Disney, so this movie stood out in a time when Super Hero movies were sort of in a dark era/phase of decline before Iron Man 1 was released 4 years later reviving the genera. The concept art, and art style of the branding of The Incredibles portrays the heros almost as if they are Gods or Demi-gods. This style really stands out compared to every other super hero comic designs that have ever come out as it has bold colour and more simplistic shapes that convey the character’s powers through movement and contrast.

Pixar always improves beyond their previous movie which makes their move to including humans in their animation to be a large shifting point for them. It is true that they included humans in Toy Story and Finding Nemo, as well as Boo in Monsters Inc, however they were never really the focus point of the film. Previously, their human characters were very robotic and plastic like, and did not move very realistically. The Incredibles aloud Pixar to explore soft-body dynamics more like with Mr. Incredible’s gut, and how human characters bodies react to the environment. Overall, this movie and it’s art direction moved on to my favourite Pixar era that includes Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, and Toy Story 3.
